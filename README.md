# Photo sharing app based on a GraphQL backend

This application is created to help people learn about GraphQL. It tries to implement most aspects of the GraphQL standard: queries, mutiations and subscriptions.

You can use this repo to build the application yourself, or you can use the hosted version available on Heroku.

## Frontend and Backend architecture

## Heroku Hosting

There are two URLs used in Heroku: one for the frontend and one for the graphQL backend
Frontend URL: https://photo-client.herokuapp.com
backend URL: https://photo-graphql.herokuapp.com/playground

The backend URL is just a graphQL api. But the /playground route is providing a GraphQL Playground where you can easily interact, test and look at the documentation of GraphQL API.
This is a great way to understand the API and its capabilities
